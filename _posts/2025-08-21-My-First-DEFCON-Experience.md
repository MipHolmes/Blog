DEF CON 33 was the first one I've attended; This was also my first time visiting Las Vegas. I enjoy exploring new places, and I love attending security conferences. 

This post won't focus predominantly on the vacation aspects of this experience or miscellaneous events during the conference, but rather will be an attempt to share the three most impactful sessions I attended.
